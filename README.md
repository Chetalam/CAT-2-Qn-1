This project demonstrates how to set up an e-commerce system using Django. It allows a customer to place multiple orders. The relationships between Customer and Order are defined, with fields to store customer details and order information.

The project consists of two main models:
-Customer: Represents a customer with their name and email.
-Order: Represents an order made by a customer, including the date and total amount.
